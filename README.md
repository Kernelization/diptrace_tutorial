# diptrace_tutorial
The repo that will host files for the DipTrace tutorial.

The first two circuits have been added. We will do a livestream showing how to create these two circuits. I recommend that you clone or fork the repo, so you can make changed separate from the rest of the group.
The first circuit is just an LED that will light up when power is applied. Super simple, but it will show the basics of how the software works.
The second circuit is an LED flasher circuit, which is a bit more advanced, but will show how nets work in a schematic.

We will be creating the actual PCB layout in the livestream.

The first livestream is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, May 17th @ 6pm EDT.

Hope to see you there! Stay tuned for details on when this will happen.
